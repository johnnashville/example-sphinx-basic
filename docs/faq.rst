Summary
---

Cohort Assignment activation mistakes are greatly reduced by implementing a Cohort Assignment review process in which multiple individuals review and approve Cohort Assignments prior to activation - sometimes requiring a sign off.  However, sometimes mistakes still happen.

Wrong _activity plan_ activated for a subject
---

1. Cancel each Form resulting from the wrong activation
2. Create a new Cohort (i.e. "Cohort 1 - Corrected") within which affected subjects can be activated correctly
3. Labels will need to be reprinted for the subject

Wrong _volunteer_ is activated
---

1. Cancel each Form resulting from the wrong activation
2. If the mistake was made in an enrollment cohort, change the incorrect subject's number to their screening number (or something arbitrary) so that the enrollment number can be reused for the correct subject
3. Create a new Cohort Assignment with the correct subject number
4. Labels will need to be printed for this new cohort assignment.
